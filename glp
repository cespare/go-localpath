# This script passes all arguments through directly to the 'go' command, possibly altering the $GOPATH
# variable beforehand. This is done by checking for the presence of a file called .glp in the current
# directory or any ancestor directory recursively up to / -- if the file does not exist, then $GOPATH is left
# unchanged. If the file exists, then $GOPATH is set so that it contains the following paths:
#
# * The current directory
# * All directories listed in .glp, in order
#
# Each line of .glp must be the name of a directory that exists. It may be an absolute or relative path. A
# typical use case will have a single directory (usually called vendor/, or third_party/, or similar).
